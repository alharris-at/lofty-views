# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Lofty Views API is a REST API feature that allows users to create, read, and manage "Lofty Views" - image resources that represent scenic or noteworthy locations. Each view contains metadata including a name, description, location information, and a count of user appreciation ("hearts"). This feature extends the existing Express TypeScript boilerplate to provide a complete CRUD interface for managing these visual content resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to create new lofty views, so that users can share and catalog scenic locations with associated metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /lofty-views with valid view data THEN the system SHALL create a new lofty view and return the created resource with a 201 status
2. WHEN a POST request is made to /lofty-views with a name field THEN the system SHALL require the name to be a non-empty string
3. WHEN a POST request is made to /lofty-views with a description field THEN the system SHALL accept the description as an optional string
4. WHEN a POST request is made to /lofty-views with a location field THEN the system SHALL accept the location as an optional string
5. WHEN a POST request is made to /lofty-views without required fields THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status with validation error details
6. WHEN a new lofty view is created THEN the system SHALL initialize the hearts count to 0
7. WHEN a new lofty view is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier to the view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve all lofty views, so that users can browse and discover available scenic locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /lofty-views THEN the system SHALL return all existing lofty views as an array
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /lofty-views and no views exist THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with a 200 status
3. WHEN a GET request is made to /lofty-views THEN the system SHALL include all view properties (id, name, description, location, hearts) in the response
4. WHEN a GET request is made to /lofty-views THEN the system SHALL return the views in a consistent order

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve a specific lofty view by its identifier, so that users can access detailed information about a particular location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /lofty-views/:id with a valid view ID THEN the system SHALL return the specific lofty view with a 200 status
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /lofty-views/:id with an invalid or non-existent ID THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status with an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a GET request is made to /lofty-views/:id with a malformed ID THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status with validation error details
4. WHEN a valid lofty view is retrieved THEN the system SHALL include all view properties (id, name, description, location, hearts) in the response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the lofty views API to follow the same architectural patterns as existing APIs, so that the codebase remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN implementing the lofty views feature THEN the system SHALL use the same ServiceResponse pattern for consistent API responses
3. WHEN implementing the lofty views feature THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive test coverage following existing testing patterns
4. WHEN implementing the lofty views feature THEN the system SHALL use Zod schemas for request validation and type safety
5. WHEN implementing the lofty views feature THEN the system SHALL include OpenAPI documentation generation
6. WHEN implementing the lofty views feature THEN the system SHALL handle errors consistently with existing error handling middleware

### Requirement 5

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lofty views API is implemented THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all service methods
2. WHEN the lofty views API is implemented THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for all API endpoints
3. WHEN the lofty views API is implemented THEN the system SHALL include controller tests for request/response handling
4. WHEN the lofty views API is implemented THEN the system SHALL include repository tests for data access operations
5. WHEN the lofty views API is implemented THEN the system SHALL generate OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
