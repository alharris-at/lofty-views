# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing user management system to provide comprehensive CRUD operations for user resources. The system currently has basic user functionality but needs additional API endpoints for creating and deleting users to support full lifecycle management. This enhancement will enable external systems and frontend applications to manage users programmatically while maintaining data integrity and following established security practices.

## Asana Task References

- **Add User Creation API**: https://app.asana.com/0/1211096092683598/1211096092683613/f (Due: Aug 19, 2025)
- **Add User Deletion API**: https://app.asana.com/0/1211096092683598/1211096092683615/f (Due: Aug 19, 2025)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to create new users via a REST endpoint, so that I can programmatically add users to the system without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /users with valid user data THEN the system SHALL create a new user record and return the created user with a 201 status code
2. WHEN a POST request is made to /users with invalid user data THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code with validation error details
3. WHEN a POST request is made to /users with duplicate user identifier THEN the system SHALL return a 409 status code with conflict error message
4. WHEN a POST request is made to /users THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are present and properly formatted
5. WHEN a user is successfully created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier to the user
6. WHEN a user is successfully created THEN the system SHALL persist the user data to the repository
7. WHEN a user creation request fails THEN the system SHALL not create any partial user records

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to delete existing users via a REST endpoint, so that I can remove users from the system when they are no longer needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DELETE request is made to /users/:id with a valid user ID THEN the system SHALL remove the user record and return a 204 status code
2. WHEN a DELETE request is made to /users/:id with a non-existent user ID THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status code with appropriate error message
3. WHEN a DELETE request is made to /users/:id with invalid ID format THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code with validation error details
4. WHEN a user is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the user data from the repository
5. WHEN a user deletion request fails due to system error THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code and maintain data integrity
6. WHEN a user deletion is attempted THEN the system SHALL validate the user ID parameter format before processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all user management operations to follow consistent error handling patterns, so that API consumers can reliably handle different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user management API encounters an error THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses using the ServiceResponse format
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed field-level error messages
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error details while protecting sensitive information
4. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL include appropriate HTTP status codes matching the operation result
5. WHEN errors are returned THEN the system SHALL include correlation IDs for debugging purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the user management APIs to integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase architecture, so that the implementation follows established patterns and maintainability standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing user creation and deletion APIs THEN the system SHALL follow the existing layered architecture pattern (Router → Controller → Service → Repository)
2. WHEN processing user management requests THEN the system SHALL use the existing middleware chain for security, rate limiting, and logging
3. WHEN validating user data THEN the system SHALL use Zod schemas consistent with existing validation patterns
4. WHEN handling user operations THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing user model and repository structure
5. WHEN documenting the APIs THEN the system SHALL generate OpenAPI specifications consistent with existing API documentation
6. WHEN implementing the endpoints THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests following the established testing patterns
